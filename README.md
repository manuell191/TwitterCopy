# TwitterCopy2
 A newer version of my original twitter copy 
 made using django, where the main differences 
 are the addition of user authorization and 
 authentication, and also a change from using 
 class based views to using function based views

 Keep in mind, this app was made as a way to
 practice, learn, and master the Django framework
